# Hi, I'm James.

### Welcome to my virtual domicile.

  
I guess the ultimate goal here is to provide somewhere for others of my particular bent to go to find something obscure or unusual to dig into when the usual GitHub fodder just isn't satisfying the need, as well as to provide a home for my (mostly Python) projects – machine learning, AI applications, data science, NLP, big data, business intelligence, financial modeling, and whatever else happens to catch my interest.
<br><br>
To put it another way, if your interests are anywhere near consonant with mine, you've hit the mother lode. If not, run like hell, but with the hopefully comforting thought that there are another billion or so repos on GitHub.
  
<h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>

The list of repositories and projects will expand in number and in content as I add public projects as well as private repository content from Gitea and GitLab. (Right. Don't stay up late waiting for the former.)
<br><br>
Some of the content will obviously be intrinsically better pieces of code than others, but intrinsic code quality will not in itself be a criterion for including/excluding a project from this site. Actually, there probably won't be any criteria for excluding projects from the site unless I have a strong visceral reaction against a particular bit of code, and even then I can probably get over it.
