# Hi, I'm James.

I use advanced analytics to extract insights from large, complex datasets and drive decision-making in business, research, and automotive (OEM) environments. I work with cross-functional teams to solve real problems, build predictive models, and deploy scalable AI that boosts efficiency, improves user experience, and fuels growth. I create AI strategies tied to business goals and find opportunities to apply machine learning for impact.

I collect, clean, and prep large datasets, apply statistical methods and ML algorithms, and build predictive models. I tune and evaluate models, push them to production, and integrate them into workflows for scale and reliability. I manage AI risk—ethics, privacy, compliance, and security—and build mitigation plans.

In education and research, I build generative AI apps and recommender systems for automated research, personalized learning, and semantic search. I use LangChain, Hugging Face, VAEs, autoencoders, and diffusion models. I connect these systems to structured databases and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), and build scalable research platforms using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD.

In automotive, I build AI/ML models using deep learning architectures (RNN, CNN, LSTM) and computer vision with OEM datasets. I apply clustering, gradient boosting, anomaly detection, and neural networks. I deploy full AI pipelines using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and no-code platforms like DataRobot and H2O.

I code in Python, Java, and C++. I work with SQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and NoSQL. I track KPIs to measure impact, fine-tune strategies, and lead AI adoption. I also advise on AI product strategy, focusing on real-world applications in business.
